# Face Library

**Secure AI Likeness Licensing Infrastructure**

Face Library is a secure licensing infrastructure for human identity in generative AI. The platform enables actors, models, influencers, and public figures to control how their digital likeness is used in AI-generated content. It provides a permission layer where brands can legally license human likeness for advertising, media, and synthetic content production.

The system solves a critical infrastructure gap in generative AI: there is currently no standardized way to manage consent, licensing, compliance, and compensation for human identity used in AI-generated media.

Built for the **UK AI Agent Hackathon EP.4 x OpenClaw** (March 2026, Imperial College London) by team **Not.Just.AI**.

## The Problem

Generative AI can now create hyper-realistic images and videos of real people. There is no standardized infrastructure for:

- **Consent** -- who gave permission for their face to be used?
- **Compensation** -- how are creators paid when their likeness generates value?
- **Compliance** -- is the usage legal under UK/EU data protection and IP law?
- **Audit** -- who used what, when, and under what terms?

## The Solution

Face Library introduces a multi-agent workflow that automates the entire licensing process:

1. **Talent** registers their identity, preferences, and usage restrictions on the platform. They can define allowed advertising categories, geographic limitations, pricing, social media links, and approval rules.
2. **Agents (Talent Agencies)** manage talent rosters with configurable approval workflows
3. **Brands** submit licensing requests describing their intended use of a digital likeness
4. **9 AI Agents** autonomously process requests through a 7-step pipeline:
   - Compliance & risk assessment
   - Dynamic price negotiation
   - UK-law-compliant IP contract generation
   - License token issuance
   - Avatar/image prompt generation
   - Likeness fingerprint scanning
   - Web3 smart contract metadata
   - Immutable audit logging
5. **Talent** reviews and approves/rejects with full transparency
6. **Brands** pay for approved licenses via Stripe Connect

The result is an end-to-end infrastructure that allows creators to control, license, and monetize their digital identity, while giving brands a legally compliant way to use AI-generated humans.

Face Library aims to become the governance layer for AI likeness licensing and the foundation for the future digital human economy.

### Multi-Channel Deployment

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Web App** | 17-page Next.js application with role-based dashboards |
| **REST API** | 38 endpoints with Swagger docs |
| **Telegram Bot** | `/search`, `/status`, `/agents` commands via webhook |
| **Stripe Connect** | Payment checkout for license commercialization |

### 7-Step Agent Pipeline

When a brand submits a license request, the orchestrator runs:

1. **Compliance & Risk Agent** -- Assesses content risk, brand risk, legal risk, ethical risk, and geographic risk using DeepSeek V3.2. Generates executive summary via Z.AI GLM-4 Plus. Returns risk level and recommendation.
2. **Pricing Negotiator Agent** -- Analyzes talent preferences and market rates using Qwen3 235B. Proposes dynamic pricing with breakdown, confidence score, and SDG 8 alignment.
3. **IP Contract Agent** -- Generates a full UK-law-compliant IP license agreement using Z.AI GLM-4 Plus (128K context). 12 sections covering parties, definitions, grant of rights, restrictions, compensation, IP ownership, data protection, warranties, termination, liability, dispute resolution, and general provisions. Falls back to FLock Qwen3 235B Thinking.
4. **License Token** -- Issues a UUID license token for tracking.
5. **Avatar Generation Agent** -- Generates detailed image/avatar prompts using DeepSeek V3.2, ready for dispatch to Z.AI image generation.
6. **Likeness Fingerprint Agent** -- Simulates unauthorized use detection scan using DeepSeek V3.2. Generates fingerprint ID and scan report with platforms checked, violations found, and risk score.
7. **Web3 Rights Agent** -- Generates ERC-721 smart contract metadata on Polygon for on-chain IP rights tracking. Produces contract address, token metadata, and estimated gas.
8. **Audit & Logging Agent** -- Logs every step with timestamps, agent identity, model used, tokens consumed, and action details. Powers the Claw Console.

If compliance recommends rejection, the pipeline short-circuits (skips steps 2-7) and logs the failure.

## Bounty Tracks

### 1. FLock.io -- Best Use of Open-Source AI Models ($5,000 USDT)

Face Library uses **all 5 FLock open-source models** as the primary LLM provider:

| Agent | Model | Tier | Purpose |
|-------|-------|------|---------|
| Pricing Negotiator | Qwen3 235B Instruct | Creative | Dynamic pricing and licensing terms |
| Compliance & Risk | DeepSeek V3.2 | Fast | Risk assessment and policy enforcement |
| IP Contract | Qwen3 235B Thinking | Reasoning (fallback) | IP contract generation |
| Avatar Generation | DeepSeek V3.2 | Fast | Image/avatar prompt generation |
| Likeness Fingerprint | DeepSeek V3.2 | Fast | Unauthorized use detection |
| Talent Discovery | DeepSeek V3.2 | Fast | AI-driven talent search |
| Onboarding Chat | DeepSeek V3.2 | Fast | Conversational profile setup |

**OpenClaw Integration:**
- Full `openclaw.json` gateway config with all 9 agents, pipeline definition, model assignments, and SDG tags
- `/api/openclaw/config` endpoint serves the gateway configuration
- Pipeline steps, human-approval flow, and workspace paths defined per agent

**Multi-Channel Deployment:**
- **Web App** (Next.js, 17 pages) -- Full role-based dashboards for talent, agents, and brands
- **REST API** (38 endpoints) -- Complete programmatic access with Swagger docs
- **Telegram Bot** -- `/search`, `/status`, `/agents` commands via webhook at `/api/telegram/webhook`

**SDG Alignment:**
- **SDG 8 (Decent Work)** -- Creating fair economic opportunities for creators. Negotiator agent ensures pricing aligns with market rates. `/api/sdg/impact` endpoint tracks creator compensation metrics.
- **SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)** -- Ensuring individual creators have the same IP protection as large corporations. Compliance agent blocks unfair requests.
- **SDG 16 (Peace, Justice)** -- Building transparent, auditable licensing infrastructure with UK law compliance. Full audit trail on every transaction.

### 2. Z.AI -- Best Use of GLM Model ($4,000 USD)

Z.AI GLM models are used as a **core component** in two agents, with a resilient 3-tier fallback chain:

**Fallback chain:** Z.AI Direct API (GLM-4 Plus) -> OpenRouter (GLM-4.5, thinking disabled) -> FLock (Qwen3 235B Thinking)

1. **IP Contract Agent (Primary)** -- Generates full 12-section UK-law-compliant IP licensing agreements covering GDPR, Copyright Act 1988, Consumer Rights Act 2015, and dispute resolution. GLM's large context window is ideal for long structured legal documents.
2. **Compliance & Risk Agent (Summary)** -- After DeepSeek performs risk analysis, GLM generates concise executive summaries for talent review. This dual-model approach combines fast analysis with high-quality summarization.

The `openclaw.json` gateway registers Z.AI as a dedicated provider. The LLM client (`llm_client.py`) automatically routes GLM requests through the best available provider, ensuring Z.AI bounty compliance regardless of direct API availability.

### 3. Claw for Human -- Most Impactful AI Agent ($500)

Face Library is built entirely on the OpenClaw platform:
- `openclaw.json` gateway configuration with FLock + Z.AI + OpenRouter providers (7 models across 3 providers)
- 9 agent definitions with workspace paths, model assignments, tools, and SDG tags
- Pipeline definition with 7 steps, blocking/non-blocking config, and human-approval gate
- Multi-channel deployment (Web, API, Telegram)
- Anyway tracing plugin for full observability (session/agent/LLM/tool spans)
- Rich agent dashboard showing per-agent stats, model registry, and SDG badges
- Claw Console for real-time audit log viewing across all agents
- Demonstrates a real-world use case: protecting human identity rights in the age of generative AI

### 4. AnyWay -- Best Use of Anyway SDK (Mac Mini)

**Anyway SDK Integration:**
- `Traceloop.init()` from `anyway-sdk` for automatic LLM call instrumentation
- Auto-instruments all OpenAI client calls (FLock, Z.AI, OpenRouter) -- captures prompts, completions, tokens, latency
- Custom spans: session-level (pipeline), agent-level (per agent), LLM-level (per call), tool-level (DB ops)
- Exports to `https://trace-dev-collector.anyway.sh/` with Bearer token auth
- 100% sample rate, full content capture

**Commercialization (Stripe Connect):**
- `POST /api/payments/checkout` -- Creates Stripe Checkout sessions for license payments
- `POST /api/payments/webhook` -- Handles payment completion events
- `GET /api/payments/revenue` -- Revenue dashboard (total revenue, platform fees, talent payouts)
- 10% platform fee model: 90% goes to talent, 10% to Face Library
- Instant pricing API at `POST /api/pricing/estimate` for algorithmic estimates
- Frontend Pay button on license detail page and brand dashboard

**Setup:**
```python
from anyway.sdk import Traceloop
Traceloop.init(
    app_name="face-library",
    api_endpoint="https://trace-dev-collector.anyway.sh/",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer <ANYWAY_API_KEY>"},
)
```

### 5. Animoca Brands -- Best Multi-Agent System ($1,000 USD)

Face Library is a coordinated multi-agent system where 9 specialized AI agents collaborate to solve a real problem -- protecting human identity rights in generative AI:

- **Multi-agent orchestration** -- 9 agents (Compliance, Negotiator, Contract, Avatar Generation, Fingerprint, Web3 Rights, Search, Audit, Orchestrator) work in a coordinated 7-step pipeline with full metadata tracking
- **Agent UX** -- Full dashboard with real-time agent activity feed (Claw Console), expandable logs, per-request audit trails, per-agent statistics, and model registry
- **Agent decision history** -- `GET /api/agents/decisions` endpoint tracks all agent decisions across the pipeline
- **Web3 integration** -- Web3 Rights Agent generates ERC-721 smart contract metadata on Polygon for on-chain IP rights
- **Real-world impact** -- Enables creators to control, monetize, and audit how their likeness is used by AI systems
